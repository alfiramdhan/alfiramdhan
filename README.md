An aspiring data analytics professional with a strong work ethic, a passion for social change and a relentless quest for skill and mastery. My expertise spans the customer persona analysis and the end-to-end sales cycle, from prospecting and objection handling to deal closing and customer nurturing. With a track record of achievement and having recently completed Revou's 3-month full-stack data analysis program, I bring a unique blend of technical proficiency in SQL and Python, along with excellent problem-solving and communication skills.
