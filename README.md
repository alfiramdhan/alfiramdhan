# Hi, I'm Alfi 👋🏾 

I am a former sales administrator and support officer with 4 years of work experience who is currently committed to dive deeper into the field of data analyst.

Due to Covid-19 impacting the company I previously worked for, I felt the need to upgrade my skills and choose a more sustainable career. I found an interest in data analysts, both in my final project and in my previous work working with data. Therefore, this prompted me to join some data analyst bootcamp courses, one of which is the fullstack data analytics program by RevoU

During the bootcamp, I learned about understanding business problem, how to do exploratory data analysis (EDA), descriptive analysis, cohort analysis, A/B testing analysis, cluster analysis, and regression analysis. Through this experience, I gained an overview of the workflow in the Data field.

Experience as sales administration and client service makes me good at analyzing customer behavior and sales, I know how to provide useful insights for businesses.
