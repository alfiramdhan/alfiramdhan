# Hi, I'm Alfi 👋🏾 

I am a former sales administrator and support officer with 4.5 years of work experience who is currently committed to dive deeper into the field of data analyst.

Since Covid-19 affected the business of the company I previously worked for, I felt the need to improve my skills and choose a more sustainable career online. During the search process, I found an interest in data analysts, because in my previous college final project I did research related to data processing analysis and in my previous work I also dealt with a lot of data, I want to explore how I can provide more value to business through data. Therefore, this prompted me to take several online data analyst courses including the RevoU, DQLab and MySkill mini courses.

During the online course, I understood the processes and metrics used in data analysis, and was able to practice and apply several programming languages such as SQL & Python. During the course, I was also given a lot of assignments to do data cleansing & formatting, to support the company's business needs. From that experience, I got an overview of the workflow in the Data field.

Experience as sales administration and client service has trained me to understand a number of customer and sales points so that when making customer and sales analysis, I know how to provide useful insights for business.
